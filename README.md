# Pazaak!

<p>Pazaak, a game from the Old Republic era, is a popular card game where the players have a set goal of reaching 20 without going over. The player with the highest score (not passing 20) wins.</p>

<p>The game consists of a Table Deck, from which a card is drawn at the start of a player's turn, and a Side Deck, from which a player's Hand is drawn. A player only draws 4 cards from the Side Deck at the start of the match. Once a card from the Hand is used, it can no longer be used in that match.</p>

<p>Players take turns drawing a card from the Table Deck. Once a card is drawn, the player may then decide if they would like to use a Hand Card. Once a decision is made, the player must then choose to Stay or End Turn.</p>

<p>If the player chooses to Stay, they no longer take turns. Their score is finalized.</p>
<p>If the player chooses to End Turn, they take another turn when their time comes.</p>

<p>Once both players Stay, or one player busts, the round ends. The player the higher score not exceeding 20 gains a point.</p>
<p>The first player to win 3 rounds wins the match.</p>
